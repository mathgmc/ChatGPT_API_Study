The mineral foundation leaves a natural finish that I love!
Finally, makeup that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.
The coverage is light and perfect for daily use, but may need touch-ups during the day.
I’ve never received so many compliments on my skin since I started using this mineral makeup.
The price is fair for the quality and skin benefits.
I love the natural ingredients; my skin appreciates it.
The mineral makeup lasts all day without feeling heavy.
The color selection could be wider, but I found a shade that works for me.
The product is good, but the packaging could be more practical.
I’m impressed with the mineral powder’s longevity; no touch-up needed.
I was glad to find out this makeup also has sun protection.
It has a luminous finish that many other brands don’t offer.
Application was easy, but a better sponge would help for a flawless finish.
Mineral makeup is perfect for those looking for a healthier alternative.
Satisfied with the purchase, but the makeup could come with a more efficient applicator.
